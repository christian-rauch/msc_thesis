First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Maurice Fallon for his guidance throughout this thesis and for creating the working environment in which I could carry out my research. It is a pleasure for me to work with him and discuss research topics in the robot perception group.

Further, a special thanks goes to the postdoctoral researchers and Ph.D. students in the Valkyrie lab for helping me in getting the robot running and supporting me in my data collection.

I finally want to thank Julia for her unending patience during this period and for supporting me on my way.
