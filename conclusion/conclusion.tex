\chapter{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
\item using prior information after calibration
\item calibrating vision by comparing observed and projected markers
\item calibration with larger motion range
\item full analysis of joint position offsets by using different mapping from reported to optimal joint value and CV on larger data set
\end{itemize}
